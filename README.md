# Weather Info

This website displays current weather conditions at the user location, as well as other cities, chosen by the user. This was created as a part of the web development course at ITMO University.

## Client-only version

As the name suggests, it's a version that only relies on the client-side JS to make requests. You can access it at https://fr0streaper.github.io/weather-info/. The source code can be found on the Releases page or on the `client-only` branch.

## Server-client version

This is a more complete version of the website, with a server implemented using Node.js (with Express) and MongoDB. Currently not hosted anywhere.
